    "ohm's law": "\n\\begin{equation}\nV = IR\n$$\nOhm's Law states that the voltage (V) across a resistor is directly proportional to the current (I) flowing through it and inversely proportional to its resistance (R). The formula for Ohm's law can be written as:\n\\begin{equation}\nV = IR\n\\end{equation}\nwhere V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance.
