    "area of a square": "\nA square is a four-sided polygon that has all sides equal in length and all angles equal to 90 degrees. The area of a square can be calculated using the following formula:\n$$A = s^2$$\nwhere $s$ represents the side length of the square. This means that the area of a square is simply the square of its side length. For example, if the side length of a square is 5 units, then its area would be:\n$$A = 5^2 = 25 \\text{ square units}$$",
    "ohm's law": "\n\\begin{equation}\nV = IR\n$$\nOhm's Law states that the voltage (V) across a resistor is directly proportional to the current (I) flowing through it and inversely proportional to its resistance (R). The formula for Ohm's law can be written as:\n\\begin{equation}\nV = IR\n\\end{equation}\nwhere V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. This means that if you increase the current flowing through a resistor, the voltage across it will also increase proportionally. Conversely, if you decrease the resistance of a resistor, the voltage across it will decrease proportionally while keeping the current constant.",
